add new obstacles, done, but*

* side obstacles, fix obstacle biome spawning. ( currently it keeps spawning damageObstacle and PHYObstacle, not Grassblade in grassland.)

Biome manager should take the prefab and the prefab contains the scriptable object data, Biome should not assign the scriptable object to each prefab, obstacle do have scriptableobject within them and thant makes them accesible to  the biome manager, if biome manager wants to find what a prefab is it has to reference the scriptbleobject in the prefab.
